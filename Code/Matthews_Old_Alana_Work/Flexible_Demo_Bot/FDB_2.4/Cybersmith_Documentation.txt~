Herein shall be the documentation of Cybersmith, known also as Matthew C G Innes, created as he produced the Script_Bot programme.

Specification: the goal here is to create a "Flexble Script Bot" (FSB) for Professor Oliver Lemon's "Alana" program. This bot will read in a script from a provided file, and use that as the basis for its conversation. This must be flexible, taking any script, as long as it is appropriately formatted.

Here are the initial steps used to set up the programming environment:

---The environement is a virtual ubuntu machine, run on Oracle VBox.
---The version of Python used was Python3.4
---The main directory used was ~/Python3/Alana
---Ioannis Papaioannou, a senior researcher, granted access to the git repositories for Alana. Specifially to the github account for The-Cybersmith
---A zip file containing a template bot was provided by Ioannis Papaioannou. This file was extracted, creating the directory ~/Python3/Alana/sample_bot
---before this could be used in any capacity, two steps had to be carried out. First, the Python framework "Flask" was installed using (pip3.4 install flask). Then the util functions from alana were downloaded (git clone https://github.com/WattSocialBot/utils) and installed (sudo python3.4 setup.py install)

Due to inexperience with Flask, some rudimentary research was done (https://pythonhow.com/how-a-flask-app-works/). Fortunately, little alteration of Flask will be needed.

For testing purposes, a program called Bot_tester.py was created.

In version 1.0, minimal classes were built

In version 1.1, basic responsiveness was implemented, and small errors in 1.0 were corrected making the code more compliant with state structure. Theoretically, a full test is now possible.

In Version 1.2, rudimentary question lists can be read and asked from a file, and a list of answers can be given.

In Version 1.3, the file formats were modified, allowing for different types of questions, and input validation

In Version 1.4, modifications to the input output interface were made, disambiguating the process, and the FSB was altered to reset if Alana ever switched over to another bot.

Version 1.5 was abandoned.

The specification was more clearly defined, as being a method for creating flexible DEMOS, rather than answering questions generally.

This lead to Flexible Demo Bot.

In Version 2.0, the system was implemented in its most basic form, reading the script and simply allowing the user to say whatever they pleased.

In Version 2.1, more sophisticated techniques were implemented, allowing the program to give no response to invalid user input.

In Version 2.2, slight changes were made to the overall program structure, and the way files are read from was adjusted to be more flexible.

In Version 2.3, the program had more print commands added, as this was primarily intended to be a version for extensive testing, to identify errors/inefficiencies. These print commands will be removed in later versions

In Version 2.4, the program will correct minor faults discovered during the testing of Version 2.3, as well as potentially make adjustments to the use of the state object. THIS IS A MODIFICATION UPON VERSION 2.2, NOT 2.3!!!!!!!

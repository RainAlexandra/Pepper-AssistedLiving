This testing took place on a single-core ubuntu virtual machine, so parellalism isn't a factor.
The process of this testing is to determine which parts of the process take more time, so the print commands have been placed around only the sections not requiring user input.
Thus, this testing should only evaluate program efficiency.

The following was run to verify that the virual machine was single-core.

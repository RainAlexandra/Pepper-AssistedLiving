Program: Thank you.  I'm now going to describe a few situations, and ask you some questions about them.  It's ok to think about your answers, and please let me know if you'd like me to repeat the question.  Do you understand?
User: yes
Program: Thank you. First, I'd like you to imagine that you are in a customer-service role, where it is your job to speak to customers, understand their needs, and try to help them.  Is this something that you enjoy?  
User: yes - I enjoy helping people
Program: Great.  I'd like you to imagine that you have been approached by a customer face to face.  She  has her arms crossed and she is frowning. How do you think the customer is feeling?
User: Annoyed
Program: Anything else?
User: Unhappy, dissatisfied maybe
Program: OK thank you.  Imagine that it is your job to deal with this customer.  Tell me what you would do in this situation?
User: I'd say hi, how can I help you?
Program: Fade out….5 minutes later Thank you for your time Douglas. From your answers you have demonstrated that you have reasonably good problem solving skills. You particularly enjoy dealing with complex problems and making decisions quickly. You could be suited to roles where you deal with complex problems and where speed of decision making is more important than accuracy Great news!  I have identified one job in your area that would be suitable for you and the skills that you have and I have entered the details in your Jobs folder of the app. From your answers, it appears you might make decisions too quickly, and risk making mistakes.   I have also sent you a link to a short video clip. It will help you to think about how you make decisions and give you some hits about how to develop your decision making skills. You can your link in the development plan of the app. Thank you for your time and have a great day Douglas. 
User: Thank you
Program: Pause and then end

# Profiler

Node-based API to facilitate user profile management.

## Dependencies

You will require NPM and a local install of MongoDB to run the profile system.

From within the ``Profiler`` directory, run ``npm install`` to install the profile system and ``npm start`` to start it. MongoDB must be running at the same time for this to work, start it with ``mongod`` in another terminal window.
